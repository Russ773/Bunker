[![Download Bunker](https://img.shields.io/badge/⬇%20Download-Bunker%20for%20Windows-e0592a?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Russ773/Bunker/releases/latest)

</div>

1. Grab **`Bunker-Setup-x.y.z.exe`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/Russ773/Bunker/releases/latest), or download the same installer from [getbunker.app](https://getbunker.app).
2. Run it. It installs just for you, with no admin prompt.
3. Start **Bunker** and enter your server's RCON details. That's it.

> 🛍️ **Easiest way: [get Bunker from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PL3409LVH1R)** (listed as **Bunker RCON**). It installs with no Windows warnings and the Store keeps it up to date.
>
> 💡 The installer above isn't code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen may say the publisher is unknown. Choose **More info → Run anyway**.
> If Windows 11's Smart App Control blocks it outright, right-click the downloaded file, open
> **Properties** and tick **Unblock** before running it.

## 🆕 What's new

Recent additions, newest ideas first:

* 📤 **Share your widgets.** Made a widget? **Widgets → Get more widgets → Share a widget** checks it, lists every command it can send, and opens GitHub with the submission filled in. It is checked automatically, read by a person, and then appears in **Browse library** for everyone.
* 🗂️ **A roomier Widgets page.** **All widgets** in the sidebar opens every widget as a tile, grouped (Favourites, Built in, Community) with a search box. The sidebar no longer has a long list to scroll, and its spacing is tighter so it fits smaller screens.
* 💾 **Export.** **Save** in the Console header writes what you can see (search and filters applied) to a text file, and **Export CSV** on the Player database saves the players as a spreadsheet that opens in Excel, Google Sheets or LibreOffice. Files go to `Documents\Bunker\Exports` by default, so your other folders stay tidy.
* 📣 **What's new after an update.** The first time a new version runs, a short note lists what changed. It never shows on a fresh install, and you can open it again from **Settings → About**.
* 🚫 **Ban list as a table.** The Ban Manager widget now shows your bans as a sortable table (Steam ID, name, reason and when each ban ends, with expired ones marked). Click a row to fill in the Steam ID, then press Unban.
* 🌐 **Multi Server.** A **Multi Server** page above Layout shows up to **six** of your servers side by side, all the same size and filling the window: online or offline (and why), players, FPS, uptime, a player chart and who is on. Open any server with one click, or **say something or run a command on all online servers** in one go (you confirm first). Add a server from the page, and choose which six to show if you have more. Bunker only keeps these extra connections while the page is open.
* 👋 **A welcome screen that shows what is possible.** On first launch you can tick **I have more servers to add** and enter several in a row, and the screen shows how the Multi Server page looks.
* 🔔 **Tray icon and notifications.** A Bunker icon in the system tray (right-click to show, connect or quit). When Bunker is minimised or behind other windows, Windows tells you about chat watch-words and a lost connection. Everything is optional in **Settings → General**, including hiding Bunker from the taskbar when minimised.
* 🔌 **Auto-reconnect.** If the connection to your server drops (a restart, a wobble, your PC waking from sleep), Bunker keeps trying to get it back and tells you in the console. Click Connect or Disconnect to stop it, or turn it off in **Settings → General**.
* ❌ **The X asks first.** Clicking the X in the corner now asks whether to **minimise** Bunker (so it stays connected and your schedules keep running) or close it. Tick *Remember my choice* to stop being asked, and change it any time in **Settings → General**.
* 💬 **Chat as yourself.** Set a name, Steam ID and colour in **Settings → Chat** and your messages show in-game with your name and Steam picture instead of SERVER (needs the small [BunkerChat plugin](plugins/BunkerChat.cs)). The console box has a **Command / Chat** switch, and asks "say this in chat?" before sending ordinary words as a command.
* 🎨 **Chat looks like the game.** Coloured player names, a green **[TEAM]** tag, plugin prefixes such as **[ADMIN]** (colour set in Settings → Chat), and no more repeated names when a chat plugin adds its own.
* 🙈 **Hide console noise.** Hide a whole plugin (`[Economics]`, `[Steam Groups]`) or any line containing words you choose, from **Console → Filter** or by right-clicking a line.
* 🔎 **Item search with pictures.** Type "wood" in **Give items** (or the player menu) and get *Wood* with its picture. The list comes from the game's own files and updates itself when Rust does.
* 📋 **Plugin lists as a table.** Carbon and Oxide plugin lists show as a sortable table (versions, hook time, memory, uptime) with failed plugins listed underneath. Click a row to fill in the plugin name.
* ⭐ **Favourite widgets.** Click the ☆ on any widget tile to make it a favourite. Favourites are what the sidebar lists under WIDGETS, so it stays short. Right-click a tile to **hide** it (it stays in Layout, and a Hidden group on the Widgets page brings it back).
* 🔄 **Widget updates.** **Settings → Updates** now lists newer versions of your community widgets, and an orange dot marks them in the menu.
* 🖱️ **One right-click menu everywhere.** The Players page, the Dashboard and the **Player database** share the same menu: copy, Steam profile, kick, ban, mute, teleport, give item and notes.
* 📥 **Import servers from RustAdmin** (Settings → Servers → Import).
* 🧩 **A clearer split.** **Core** (Dashboard, Console, Players, Layout, Settings) and **Widgets** (everything optional) have their own headings in the sidebar.
* 🛡️ **Update checks no longer hit GitHub's rate limit**, and the app starts, connects and recovers more gracefully.

## ✨ Features

Bunker is split in two so it is always clear what is part of the app and what is an add-on.

### 🏠 Core: always there

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 🖥️ **Console** | The heart of Bunker. Colour-coded live output and a command box that runs **any** console command. Command history with ↑/↓, **search and filters** (hide chat, warnings, errors, **a whole plugin such as [Economics], or any line containing words you choose**), auto-scroll, and your choice of **font and size**. Chat appears the way it does in the game, and a **Command / Chat** switch lets you talk from the same box. |
| 📊 **Dashboard** | Live players, FPS, entities, uptime, memory and map, with the player list and console in one glance. |
| 👥 **Players** | Who's online with ping, time played and health. Right-click for copy, Steam profile, kick, ban, mute, teleport, give an item (with picture search), or a private note. The same menu works in the Dashboard and the Player database. |
| 🌐 **Multi Server** | Up to six servers on one page, equal cards that fill the window: status, players, FPS, uptime, a player chart and who is on for each, a one-click Open, and a box to send a message or command to every online server. |
| 🪟 **Layout** | Pick 1, 2 or 4 sections and put a core panel *or any widget* in each. Go **fullscreen** for a wall-display control room. |
| 💬 **Chat** | Send chat from Bunker with your own name, colour and Steam picture instead of SERVER (**Settings → Chat**). It needs the small [BunkerChat plugin](plugins/BunkerChat.cs) on the server (Carbon or Oxide); without it Bunker falls back to the plain `say` command with your name in the text. Messages from players show with their name colour, **[TEAM]** and plugin prefixes such as **[ADMIN]**. |
| ⚙️ **Settings** | Several saved servers (passwords encrypted for your Windows account), **import from RustAdmin**, dark and light themes, console font, your chat name and colours, startup options, what the X in the corner does (ask, minimise or close), and updates for both Bunker and your widgets that *ask first*. |

### 🧩 Widgets: optional add-ons

**All widgets** (under the WIDGETS heading in the sidebar) opens a page with every widget as a tile, grouped as Favourites, Built in and Community, with a search box. Click a tile to open the widget, with a live console beside it so you see the server's reply. **Add to Layout** puts any widget into a Layout section in one click. Click the **☆** on a tile to make it a favourite: favourites are listed in the sidebar, so the ones you use most are one click away. Right-click a tile to hide it; hidden widgets stay available in the Layout picker and wait in a Hidden group at the bottom of the page. An orange **Update available** marks a community widget that has a newer version (see **Settings → Updates**).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Built-in** · Announce, Quick actions, Moderation, Teleport, Shortcuts, Give items | One-click helpers for the things you do most. **Give items** has a searchable list of every current Rust item with its picture, kept up to date automatically when Rust updates. |
| **Built-in** · 📈 Server health | Live charts of FPS, players, entities and memory over 5 minutes to 2 hours. Spot lag spikes and restarts at a glance. |
| **Built-in** · ⏰ Scheduler | Recurring announcements, a daily world save, restart warning sequences with `wait` steps. |
| **Built-in** · 🗂️ Player database and Join/leave feed | Everyone who has joined, with **your own notes**, plus a live feed. Right-click anyone for the full player menu, even if they have left. |
| **Built-in** · 💬 Chat monitor | Watch-words that highlight messages and flash the taskbar, with mute, kick and ban from a message. |
| **Community** | Install widgets other people made. They can show live stats, command replies (plugin lists become a **sortable table**) and run timed sequences, and are reviewed command by command first. [Write your own →](docs/WIDGETS.md) |

## 🚀 Getting started

### 1. Turn on WebRCON on your Rust server

Add these to your server's startup parameters, then restart it:

```text
+rcon.web 1 +rcon.port 28016 +rcon.password "choose-a-strong-password"
```

Make sure the RCON port (`28016` here) is reachable from your PC. On a hosted server that usually means opening it in the firewall.

### 2. Connect

Start Bunker. The welcome screen asks for:

| Field | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Server name | `My Rust Server` (optional) |
| Server address | `123.45.67.89` or `play.example.com` |
| RCON port | `28016` |
| RCON password | the one you set above |

Press **Test & connect**. Bunker checks the connection before saving anything. Offline right now? Choose **Save without testing**.

### 3. Optional: chat as yourself

To send chat with your own name and Steam picture, copy **BunkerChat.cs** (a button in **Settings → Chat**, or [from here](plugins/BunkerChat.cs)) into your server's `carbon/plugins` (Carbon) or `oxide/plugins` (Oxide) folder. It adds one admin-only command, `bunker.say`, and loads by itself. Bunker works fine without it.

### 4. Explore

* **Core** (Dashboard, Console, Players) is the app itself. The **Console** is where you read the server and run any command.
* **Widgets** holds the optional add-ons: announcements, moderation, charts, the scheduler and anything you install. **Layout** lets you build your own screen from core panels and widgets.
* Click the server name in the sidebar to switch servers. **Settings** has themes, fonts, startup options and updates.

> ⌨️ **Tips:** `↑`/`↓` recall previous commands · `Esc` or `F11` leaves fullscreen · right-click a player for quick actions · right-click a console line to hide that plugin · star the widgets you use most · hover long names for a tooltip.

---

## 🧩 Community widgets

A **widget** is a small `.json` file, **never a program**. It describes some fields and buttons, and lists every console command each button can send:

```json
{
  "id": "resource-drop",
  "name": "Resource Drop",
  "description": "Reward everyone online with a resource.",
  "controls": [
    { "type": "choice", "id": "item", "label": "Resource", "options": ["wood", "stones", "scrap"] },
    { "type": "number", "id": "amount", "label": "Amount each", "default": 500, "min": 1, "max": 5000 },
    {
      "type": "button",
      "text": "Give to everyone",
      "confirm": "Give {amount} x {item} to EVERY player?",
      "commands": [ "inventory.giveall {item} {amount}", "say \"Everyone just received {amount} {item}!\"" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

* 🔍 **Reviewed before install.** Bunker lists *every* command a widget can send, and marks risky ones (kick, ban, restart, give-to-everyone…) with `!`.
* 🚫 **Hard limits.** Widgets can't touch RCON settings or admin rights, can't run scripts and can't reach the network.
* 🧼 **Cleaned inputs.** Text typed into a widget has quotes, semicolons and control characters removed before it's used.
* ⚡ **More than buttons.** Widgets can show **live server stats**, display the server's **replies** in a panel (a Carbon or Oxide plugin list becomes a **sortable table**), and run **timed sequences** with a Stop button, such as countdowns.
* 📚 **Try the starters** in [`widgets/`](widgets): *Welcome Packs*, *Broadcast Presets*, *Resource Drop*, *Event Countdown*, *Server Report*, *Ban Manager*, *Oxide Plugin Control* and *Carbon Plugin Control*. Install them from **Widgets → Get more widgets → Browse library**.

Want to make one? Read the **[widget guide](docs/WIDGETS.md)** and open a pull request. 💜

## 🔒 Safety & privacy

* 🔐 **RCON passwords are encrypted** with Windows DPAPI, so only your Windows account can read them.
* 📡 Bunker talks to **your server** and to **GitHub** (to check for updates to Bunker and your widgets, the Rust item list and pictures, and, if you open it, the widget library). The Rust item list and pictures come from [bobosneefdev/rust-items-json](https://github.com/bobosneefdev/rust-items-json) on GitHub, at most once a day, and can be switched off in **Settings → General**. Nothing else, and no analytics.
* 🙋 **Updates always ask first.** Nothing installs without your OK, and a widget update shows you everything it can do before it replaces the old one.
* 🧹 **Uninstalling removes everything.** The uninstaller deletes the program and, when you say yes, all the data Bunker saved (servers and their encrypted passwords, player notes, schedules, widgets and item pictures, all kept in `%APPDATA%Bunker`). A silent uninstall removes it all without asking. The Microsoft Store version is removed by Windows in the usual way.
* 🧪 The widget safety rules have **automated tests** that run on every release.
